# Sport Facility Booking Program

## For United Nations Internation School of Hanoi

The program enables users to book time slots in sports facilities around the school. The program displays the weekly schedule of the desired facility and curates personalized schedules for each user. Users will be able to 

- **create** an account,
- **pick** a free time slot they want to book,
- **view** their personal and facility schedules,
- and **remove** any time slots they have already booked.

The program also monitors current AQI and temperature indices to warn administrators of affected bookings; if the temperature and AQI are above 40 and 150 respectively, a list of outside bookings are displayed to the administrator. Additionally, administrators have enhanced capabilities such as the ability to view any user's schedules and remove their bookings.
